# Swipe North
A team project made together with the excellent [Paola](https://github.com/prickar) and [David](https://github.com/DavidDyberg) as an assignment in our Javascript Frameworks course in collaboration with ad company [Familjen](https://www.familjen.se/) and [Skellefte√• county](https://skelleftea.se/), Sweden. The goal was to cretae a "Tinder like webb app for finding jobs". The app is by design made to be used on mobile.

## What I Used
- CSS
-   Dynamic routing
-   ESlint
-   Imports
-   Next js
-   Not found function
-   NPM packages
-   Prettier
-   UseState

## What I Learned
It was fun working as a team and have a real world goal in mind. I focused on making the app work, setting up the API endpoint and fine tuning the swipe function. There was a considerable time crunch on this project which I guess heightened the "real" feel but also set some limitations for the project. A great experience!
